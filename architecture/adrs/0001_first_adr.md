# ADR 0001: Neosofia Architecture, Design, and Implementation Principles

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need to establish a guiding set of principles that every system within Neosofia must follow.

## Decision

* We will use Architecture Decision Records, as described by Michael Nygard in this [article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
* All architecture diagrams and models will employ the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/)
* We will follow the principle of least privilege for all software systems
* We will ensure users of all software systems are qualified, trained, and authorized to perform an activity
* We will ensure these principles are followed by validating them through an automated policy checking service

## Consequences

All future ADRs, designs, and implementation must be validated to confirm they adhere to these standards.
