## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, inclusive, and professional environment, we as employees, contractors, and partners pledge to make participation in our company and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

All Neosofia employees and community members should demonstrate behavior that contributes to a positive environment including:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Conversely, put -- Don't break the law and don't be an [asshole][asshole]. If what you do or say falls into one of the categories below, you're probably being an asshole.[^credit]

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing Neosofia. Examples of representing Neosofia include using an official company e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is the result of applying Neosofia's incident management procedures.
