# Resources

At Neosofia, we want to build trust through transparency. We're also committed to helping other organizations continually evolve their regulatory compliance to drive a more secure and efficient business operation. The resources below are a starting point for those who have never operated in a regulated industry before. If you have experience working in a regulated industry, these resources are designed to challenge traditional solutions to create a higher level of compliance and efficiency within your organization.

## Our Philosophy 

Our logo is a manifestation of our philosophy of traceability and transparency. Each node in the circuit diagram of the brain represents a regulation, policy, procedure, person, role, guide, implementation, evidence, etc. that forms a highly interconnected network of compliance. Most organizations treat each node type as an isolated entity that is managed independently of each other. SOPs go into an obscure folder in the companies file management system that is only accessible by select individuals, job description/roles/levels are non-existent, infrequently updated, and never tie into the actual procedural responsibilities, procedures are written but not followed, employees are expected to follow undocumented procedures. The list of inefficiencies that come from this disconnected approach to compliance and business operations in general is near infinite.

## Our Phased Approach to Helping Your Company

Our end state, per our first [blog post][blog-0000], is a set of [SaaS][saas] tools that give any organization a higher degree of compliance and operational efficiency. These tools will be the result of years of evolution so we'll be taking a phased approach to this project.

### Phase 1: Manually Curated QMS

As we build out our compliance tools, we'll manually curate and publish Neosofia's QMS. This will be done for two reasons:
 * Act as a resource for other organizations to follow
 * Inform the architecture and design of the compliance tools by producing what the inputs and outputs of the tools would look like

### Phase 2: Automatically Generated and Managed QMS

The endpoint of phase two would be a set of tools that enables tech-savvy organizations to improve their compliance and efficiency through actionable and easy to understand reports.

### Phase 3: Compliance for All (QMS+)

A system that any organization can use to start/become compliant and maintain their compliance through any evolution of their organization. The system will be like your AI compliance buddy that always does the right thing for your organization ;)
