## Level 3 Checklist

Level three organizations are where the compliance volume is cranked up to 11. The best way to summarize a level three organizations is to make a general statement that every action needed to achieve something takes no fewer than three people. Here are some examples:

 * To create or update any controlled document you need an: Author, Reviewer and Approver (GDP)
 * To make any change to a software system, you need a: Product owner, Engineer, and QC. (SDLC/CSV)
 * To update any "medium/high" risk change on any "high" risk IT system you need a unique person to: Initiate/Author, Review, Approve, Implement, and Verify the CR.

In addition to the separation of responsibilities you must also follow the principle of least privilege throughout all of your [EASs][eas-ex] and provide evidence that your procedures were executed as indicated in the SOPs. We won't create a checklist here as level three organizations will typically have their own industry specific checklist to go through which will be covered in future [blog][/blog/] posts.
