# Quality Management System (QMS)

Per our [glossary][glos], a QMS is

> A formalized system that documents processes, procedures, and responsibilities for achieving quality [policies][pol] and objectives. It helps coordinate and direct an organizationâ€™s activities to meet customer and regulatory requirements and improve its effectiveness and efficiency on a continuous basis.

If you read our blog post regarding our definition of the three [levels of compliance][blog-0005], a [QMS][qms] is typically defined for some [level two][lvl] organizations and most [level three][lvl] organizations. Some [level one][lvl] organizations could benefit from standardizing company procedures like onboarding, accounting, technical system administration, etc. but having a formal [SOP][sop] with formalized training is typically not needed.

From the definition of the [elements of a QMS][qms], we'll run an organization through the following checklist(s) to determine what actions need to be taken in order to comply with the regulation that govern them.
