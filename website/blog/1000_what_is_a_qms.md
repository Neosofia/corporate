# What is a Quality Management System (QMS)

## TL;DR

## Why?

## How? 

## Challenging Traditional GDP

Those of you that have worked with more traditional SOPs may have found them lacking as they typically don't point you to the actual architecture/design/implementation (if automated), evidence that the SOP is being followed, regulations that the SOP/evidence supports, etc. Our SOP enhances the traditional Word Doc SOP by:
* Directly linking to terms in a central glossary
* Directly linking to roles in a central role definition document
* Linking responsibilities to roles and job levels. Maybe we can programmatically generate JDs!
* Forcing us to think about the content vs spending hours trying to get Word to properly indent and number our sections :sob:
* Using signed commits to act as a *valid* electronic signature
* Using Git and GitHub metadata to act as a revision history and automatically version control the document. The change log is the commit history with exact diffs!
* SLOs to measure quality
* Tying a version-locked document generation tool (md to pdf) to produce exact (paper A4? Letter? Legal?) copies of SOPs as they existed at the point in time they were authored, reviewed, and approved including section numbering and change history authors, etc.

All the points above will be covered in future posts as we dive deeper into our quality management system.
