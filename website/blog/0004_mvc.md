# Minimal Viable Compliance (MVC)

In our prior posts, we explored what compliance is and how to achieve it for a simple example with TLS versioning. However, our simple TLS example only satisfies a tiny percentage of the regulatory rules that exist in the world. This led me to the question: What are the absolute essential policies that transcend all regulations and are best practices for any organization to have in place? This post will outline what policies and procedures an organization should think through before focusing on anything else related to compliance.


## TL;DR

Compliance is hard, but it doesn't have to be. Do the following things, and you'll be well on your way to running a secure and compliant business.
1. Map out where data enters, moves through, is stored long term, and leaves your organization
1. Define retention periods for every system that stores information
1. Have well-defined and tested system backup and recovery procedures
1. Ensure all systems employ encryption at rest and in flight
1. Protect all of your EASs with SSO and MFA

## Data Data Data

Whether it's client data, employee data, or potential employee/client data -- understanding the information you collect, who has access to it, and how/when it's accessed/used is essential to achieving MVC.

### Data Collected/Managed

Even if it's a scribble on a napkin, start by listing out all the information you take in to provide your clients with services AND all the data you ingest to operate your company. For a typical small to medium size company, it would look something like this:

* Potential Employees: Resumes and contact info via email or the website and then stored in an HRMS.
* Potential Clients: Email addresses and contact information collected from the website, email, and networking events. Information is stored in a CRM. Tracking cookies are used to target potential clients on the website.
* Current Clients: Information gathered on our website including contact information and other non-public information used to provide services and goods.
* Current Employees: Sensitive information gathered via email and online forms during the onboarding process. Public information regarding their CV and qualifications. Highly sensitive non-public information used for payroll and healthcare services entered directly into the HRMS.
 * Company IP: The secret sauce that makes your company valuable to others. For tech companies this is usually the source code that provides a service to the client, for a law firm this might be well crafted legal templates, for a services company it's their internal knowledge base plus people, and for a restaurant it might be, well, an actual secret sauce recipe :)

 ### Landmines

Most organizations focus on their IP as they feel it's the one thing above all else that will allow them to continue to grow and be profitable. Current client data typically is the second most protected data asset as a leak of that information could lead to a loss of business. The other data asset types are (typically) a very distant third for smaller organizations in terms of priority. 

Regardless of the type of data we store, there are four mediums that **must** be secured in order to protect the vast majority of our data.

#### #1 Email and Chat

By far, the greatest PITA as it relates to data leaks are emails and chats. It's a common attack vector for phishing attempts to compromise security and is a typical dumping ground for millions of pieces of employee PII, client data, client PII, etc. This storage medium is also a funnel and long term storage mechanism for billions of employees around the world. Using email as a data dumping ground is a problem as it gives hackers access to a wealth of information should they gain access to a single system. It's also very easy to lose control of the data due to accidental forwarding of information or an all too curious/disgruntled IT system administrator.

In order to prevent data loss of sensitive information, Neosofia will adopt the following policies:

* All emails, without exception, will be deleted after 30 days
* All chat messages, without exception, will be deleted after 30 days
* All EASs must be accessed through a single sign on solution (SSO). 
* An EAS that does not support SSO may be used if the data that it manages is classified as low sensitivity or publicly accessible.
* All systems must have multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled. Authenticator apps with biometric verification are preferred for MFA with SMS as a fallback option if app based MFA is not an option.

The email and chat policies act as a forcing function to put data where it belongs. For things like resumes, you need to put them into the HRMS, for client data the CRM, for system access credentials put them into your credential management solution. You still have the flexibility that email offers, but you have a finite amount of time to properly file information in it's "well managed" source of truth system. To put the policy implication a little more plainly

-Benjamin Young

I understand that this may be a hard pill for many to swallow (M.A. I'm looking at you and your 25k JIRA messages sent over the last 15 years), but hear me out. When was the last time you actually needed an email more than 30 days old? 90? 180? If that email was deleted, couldn't you ask the sender to resend it? If it's a computer system that sent the email, just log into the system and look at the audit trail! Or perhaps you like to use email as a task or document management system -- might I recommend that you just use a task or document management system, or perhaps finish your to-dos in 30 days :) To be clear -- 30 days is VERY aggressive, most large organizations have 90, 180, or 365 day policies regarding email/chat retention. It's your company at the end of the day, but I strongly recommend putting some type of retention limit plus SSO and MFA policies in place.

The chat and email retention policies have the added benefit of limiting the legal discovery process to 30 days for both systems should your company ever be sued. Not that your organization would do anything illegal, it just makes the process of giving over relevant information easier as your legal team does not have to sift through years of unstructured emails and documents to determine if they're applicable to the lawsuit in question. We'll need some policies to retain emails longer than our 30-day limit to support legal processes, but that will be an advanced compliance topic for another day in addition to these other policies:

* All system logins will be logged and analyzed for atypical access patterns (SIEM)
* Passwords will be no less than 15 characters in length and rotated on an annual basis
* Accounts will be locked after 5 failed login attempts
* All employees will be trained on anti-phishing tactics

#### #2 File Sharing Systems

Have you ever filled out a Google/Cloud Form for an employer, client, service provider? Did a co-worker ever ask you to share a large client database in Google Drive? Box? iCloud? When you shared the data, did you know who has access to the data? Just the one person? Are they able to share the data again without your knowledge? It's no surprise that file sharing systems are the second-largest source of data leaks and compromises. The situation with file sharing systems is slightly better than emails as you typically have better logging and monitoring for these systems and there is typically a robust RBAC system that can be used to manage the data. Despite the better tools to manage file sharing systems, we still need to have some policies in place to secure our data.

To help prevent data loss, Neosofia will adopt the following file sharing policies:

* Once per year, all documents not accessed or modified for over 365 days will be archived for long term storage
* Once per year, all long term storage documents older than two years will be purged. This policy does not apply to financial or legal documents that must be retained for more than two years.
* All file sharing activity will be logged.
* Well-defined system backup and recovery procedures will be established to protect against data compromise or loss
* All documents and long term storage mediums will be encrypted at rest and in flight
* Decryption credentials will only be accessible to IT system administrators that are responsible for the system backup and recovery procedures.

Advanced policies to cover in future posts will include:

* Documents may only be shared with internal company employees via pre-defined functional teams
* If documents/data must be shared with clients, service providers or external contractors, access must be password protected and limited to 28 days.
* The file sharing system will only be accessible from a company approved/managed device (DLP)
* All file sharing and access will be logged and analyzed for atypical patterns access patterns (SIEM)

#### #3 Employee Workstations

Have you ever asked or been asked to watch somebody's work laptop while at a café? Did you ever have your device stolen from a café? Did you ever have your device stolen from a café and then a few days later all the sensitive client data that was on it shows up on the dark web for sale at a very modest 3.8 million dollars? Did you make your employer pay the bill or did you eat the cost to avoid the embarrassment of having to report the incident to your boss? Did you quit your job and flee the country?

To prevent data loss from an employee workstation, Neosofia will adopt the following policies
* All company workstations will employ disk level encryption to ensure all information is encrypted at rest
* All company workstations will require username and password authentication to unlock the disk encryption
* All company workstations will employ a 30-minute screen saver timeout to force re-authentication. For portable systems, lid shut events will force re-authentication and all employees that leave their workstation unattended must lock the screen in public spaces. 

If you're working at a café and need to use the WC, just shut your laptop lid before you get up! I would rather pay 2-3K for a new laptop than a 2-3M ransom.

Workstations can also be compromised in less physical ways that we'll discuss in future posts such as:
* Workstations will not allow access to USB storage devices (DLP)
* Workstations will have security patches applied no less than once per month (CVE management)
* Workstations will have antivirus software installed 🤮 (Malware)
* Workstations will use sinkhole DNS providers (Malware)


#### #4 The Cloud (raw Compute/Storage and 3rd party services)
