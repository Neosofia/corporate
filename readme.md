If you're interested in building out a quality management system (QMS) the Neosofia [procedures](/website/procedures/), [policies](/shared/policies.md), and [roles](/shared/roles.md) can be used as a template for your organization. You can also use some of the concepts like full traceability to apply to an existing QMS.
